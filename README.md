### This project helped me in learning many things about web development and major stuff related to `Backend` working
This project consist of `four main sessions`
  * `user authentication section`
  * `storing of data`
  * `Inroductions to themes`
  * `Extensively worked with jinja for dynamic updation`

This prject helped me for searching new problems like APi calling, even though i didnt use any sort of API calling in this project but if this project is done using API calling it would have been more intrestingt

##### I will continue to do my project using API in further projects :)..
